This creates a form that is also synced to corp. Users can click the link to the (form)[https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyK3_x3o0jf0CDbgFWaPaB5zXLI8ivclp5w7L0f4WyrtED5vfWRUPhfHN42bYUXF1Ij/exec] to update their allocations. Note: This was created as a solution for tracking QM and Consultant assignments in an intuitive way until the corp gen ai ops hub tool was launched allowing them to assign a role in a project. It is still currently used by those with remotasks emails, as only those with contractors.scale or scale emails are able to do this right now.
This was done by first creating a query in redash to pull all projects for Gen AI, and from there the user goes to the form link and enters their email address, project id(s) delimited with a comma, and selects their role (QM/Consultant). Upon entering the ID, the redash query is triggered with a gsheet where the query is synced, and displays the project name, and sto's emails to confirm the user entered the correct id. Upon submission the sheet updates by removing any previous assignments for the entered email, and replaces those with the new id(s) and project data. 
  Later I also added a feature to where it updates the project data hourly to reflect updates to the project name and sto's.
